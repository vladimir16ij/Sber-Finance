Two microservices for Bank transactions: sber.finance and sber.finance.transactions.
!!!Both microservices have model package (DTO Entities) - it should be one dependency included in pom!!!

Example of code. Doesnt have tests, logging. Kafka is used for communication between services. Some logic is written with help of comments
